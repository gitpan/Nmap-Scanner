<title>Nmap::Scanner: perl class wrappers for the scanning tool nmap</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h1 align="center">Nmap::Scanner</h1>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Nmap::Scanner is a
set of perl classes that provide a programmatic interface to the <a
href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/">nmap</a> port
scanning tool. Nmap::Scanner parses the output from nmap as it runs. 
This is not ideal, but it is maintainable and keeps wrapper class sets
like my own from having to be too tightly tied to the nmap source.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/">Nmap</a>
 provides several output formats; Nmap::Scanner
parses the output of the &quot;XML&quot; format 
(<code>-oX</code>).I use this format because in super-verbose mode 
(<code>-v -v -v</code>) nmap outputs a large amount of information 
during the scan about what is happening.  This allows me to hook callbacks 
into the output stream and allows me to provide an event-driven programming 
model option for Nmap::Scanner users.</p>

A patch I did to add the nmap XML &lt;addport&gt; output didn't quite
go right (I messed it up) so the addport line was added twice in the 
corresponding .c source file from nmap :(.

    Please use this version (3.21) or LATER, which has the dup line removed:<p>

<p align="left">Versions earlier than .5 parsed the 'normal' output from
nmap.  This was very unstable.  All present and future versions will parse
the XML output as that is much more stable and easy to parse.
</p>
<p>Please note that versions from .5 on require that you use an nmap that
is of version 3.10 or later.  I had to submit some very small patches for
the XML output of nmap in order to get the same information the 'normal'
mode emitted for port found events.  Versions previous to 3.10 will most
likely still work but 'port found' event functionality will be missing.
</p>

<p>Please also note that this module set requires both
   XML::SAX and XML::SAX::PurePerl be installed in order for the XML
   parsing to work; both of these modules can be downloaded and 
   installed from CPAN by hand or by using the CPAN perl module.</p>

<p>Nmap::Scanner is also available via 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Nmap-Scanner">CPAN</a>, 
the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. New
versions will appear here first, as I prefer to have people use
and test a new version before it goes to the perl repository.</p>
