Revision history for Perl extension Nmap::Scanner.

0.01  Thu Feb  7 20:10:47 EST 2002
	- First attempt at upload and release.
0.2   
    - Added OsGuess class to model OS guess and TCP fingerprint output
      of nmap; if guess_os() is used in scanner, the host will have
      an OsGuess member available via the os_guess getter.
    - Added first version of XML output to Nmap::Scanner ... this is
      a very lightweight XML output that uses no extra libraries ...
      each model class has an as_xml() method that produces a string version
      of itself as valid XML.  I did this so that, regardless of backend,
      XML output could be retrieved.  Perhpas down the road it will
      be deprecated once Nmap::Scanner is reading the XML output of
      nmap.
    - Bug fix.  Multiple host scan complete events were not being fired
      properly due to some bad logic in Nmap::Scanner::Backend::Normal.
      This would cause only the LAST host in a list to trigger the
      host complete event ... so all Util programs broke as well as
      any program that uses event-based scanning with multiple hosts.
0.5
    - Changed to using the XML output format from nmap.
    - Changed object model to match the XML output.
    - Added scan($options) so that users don't have to learn MY method names
      just to use the module set.
    - Added more examples.
    - Eliminated all "normal" output processors and the Factory sub-package, as
      it is not needed anymore.
    - Eliminated Protocol and ProtocolList models as XML output defines protocols
      as ports of type IP.
    - Changed tests to ONLY use tcp connect scans so we don't have install problems
      for non-root users (reported to me by the CPAN testers .. thanks!)
    - Eliminated all Nmap::Scanner::Util modules except BannerScanner .. moved others
      into examples/ as they really aren't core.
