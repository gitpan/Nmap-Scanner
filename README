SYNOPSIS

Nmap::Scanner provides perl class wrappers for the network mapping
tool nmap.  In this release, only what I viewed as the most often
used options and settings are included ... this is not a full implementation
of the nmap API, but it is more than enough to do some very useful
things with the modules.  Over time I am sure the gaps will be filled in.

This module does require that nmap be installed in order to do anything
useful with it ... when it is installed, put it in your PATH or specify
where nmap is located using the nmap_location() method of 
Nmap::Scanner::Scanner.  Get nmap from http://www.insecure.org/nmap/

This module parses the output from -oN ... so there may be inter-version
bugs (I hope they are few as that will not be an easy thing to handle).  
A future release will parse the XML output, though that doesn't seem to 
give the same level of direct feedback the -oN output does, so my event 
handling may change or decrease.

A good way to get started is to look at the tests and the scripts in the
examples/ directory.

Please feel free to write me with questions you have about this module
or feature requests/suggestions.  

Finally, please remember this is the first release of this module, it is likely
to change somewhat, though I hope to keep the interface very much similar
to what it is at this point in time.
